# Sample note for your Knowledge Base

This is a short note so you can try the chatbot without adding your own files.

## What this project does

- **Index** documents from the `data/` folder (PDF, Markdown, text) and optionally a GitHub repo.
- **Embed** chunks with OpenAI and store them in Chroma.
- **Chat**: you ask a question; the app retrieves relevant chunks and the LLM answers using only that context, with source citations.

## Example questions you can ask

- What is this project?
- Where do I put my documents?
- How does the app answer questions?

Delete this file or add your own PDFs and notes, then click **Index documents** in the sidebar.
